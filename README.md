# Ski Cat 2: Electric Boogaloo

I had way too many issues with installing p5, so this is run off that Raspberry pi editor online. You'll have to go to the ski cat one so that you can use the images there (Since you can't add custom images. It's a pretty big hassle, but I didn't really have any other option)
